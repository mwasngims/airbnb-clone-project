## 🗃️ Database Design

### 📌 Key Entities & Fields

#### 1. Users
- `id` (PK)
- `username`
- `email`
- `password_hash`
- `role` (host or guest)

#### 2. Properties
- `id` (PK)
- `title`
- `description`
- `location`
- `price_per_night`
- `owner_id` (FK to Users)

#### 3. Bookings
- `id` (PK)
- `user_id` (FK)
- `property_id` (FK)
- `check_in_date`
- `check_out_date`
- `status`

#### 4. Payments
- `id` (PK)
- `booking_id` (FK)
- `amount`
- `status`
- `payment_method`

#### 5. Reviews
- `id` (PK)
- `user_id` (FK)
- `property_id` (FK)
- `rating`
- `comment`

### 🔗 Entity Relationships
- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.
- A **Booking** is linked to one **Property** and one **User**.
- A **Payment** belongs to a **Booking**.
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**.

## 🔐 API Security

### 🔑 Key Security Measures

- **Authentication**: Using JWT or token-based login to protect routes.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access—only hosts can manage properties; guests can book.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse using request throttling.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure input validation and sanitize all data received.
- **HTTPS**: Secure all communication between client and server.

### 🛡️ Why Security Is Critical
- **User Data**: To protect emails, passwords, and booking history.
- **Payment Info**: To prevent fraud and maintain trust.
- **System Integrity**: To avoid misuse and downtime.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### 🚀 Overview
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment ensures faster delivery with consistent quality. Every push triggers automated testing and deployment workflows.

### ⚙️ Tools & Workflow

- **GitHub Actions**: For linting, running test suites, building Docker images, and deploying.
- **Docker**: Containers ensure consistent environments across dev, staging, and production.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS** *(optional)*: Can be used as deployment targets.
